# Accented-English-Speech-Recognition-and-Transcription : ASR Performance Evaluation and Fine-tuning Project

## Overview

The aim of this project is to evaluate the performance of two Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Models: Speech2Text and Whisper, across various accents. Additionally, the project explores the impact of fine-tuning these models to enhance their performance on selected accents.
